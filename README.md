# alpha-shapes
 Alpha-shapes in spatial networks.

 In this repository we can find a .Rmd document where it was implemented a **Shiny** function with the following characteristics:
-   It shows on an interactive map the points where we find gas stations and electric vehicle charging points in the geographical area of the Valencian Community, in Spain.

-   We also find two layers for the visualization of the alpha-shapes associated with these sets of points.

-   We have a bar where we select the value of the alpha parameter. The alpha value has a range of values between 1 and 20 kilometers and uniquely determines the geometry of the sets of points analyzed.

-   We also have three different types of maps to perform visualizations.

In the data folder we have the datasets associated to the study developed. Two .csv tables provide us the localization of the points obtained from OpenStreetMap related to the gas stations and EV charging points. In the imagenes folder we have placed some static images that illustrate the numerical results.
