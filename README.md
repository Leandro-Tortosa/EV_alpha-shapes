# alpha-shapes
 Alpha-shapes in spatial networks.

 In this repository we can find a .Rmd document where it was implemented a **Shiny** function with the following characteristics:
-   It shows on an interactive map the points where we find gas stations and electric vehicle charging points in the geographical area of the Valencian Community, in Spain.

-   We also find two layers for the visualization of the alpha-shapes associated with these sets of points.

-   We have a bar where we select the value of the alpha parameter. The alpha value has a range of values between 1 and 20 kilometers and uniquely determines the geometry of the sets of points analyzed.

-   We also have three different types of maps to perform visualizations.
